What is Caching?

Caching is the process in which server response is stored so that a cached copy can be used when required and there is no need of generating the same response again.

Only the client is able to cache the response and that too for a limited period of time.

Mentioned below are the header of the resources and their brief description so that they can be identified for the caching process:

Cache control header
Time and date at which the cached resource will expire.
